# Collaboration & Git Sync

Agin Requests can save the requests to a Git repository. This feature is useful when you want to share your requests with your team or keep them in sync across multiple devices.

### Changing save location

By default the requests are saved in your computer's local storage. You can change that by choosing a folder in the sidebar.

<Image src="/images/folders.png" width={200} height={235} style={{ marginTop: '12px', borderRadius: '5px' }} />

<Callout type="info">
**Note**: If you don't see the dropdown, try opening a folder in VS Code first.
</Callout>

### Setting the default location

If you want Agin Requests to automatically switch the save location, you can modify the `agin-requests.defaultContext` setting.
