# Authorization

Agin Requests supports multiple methods of authorization, such as **Bearer Tokens**, **Basic Auth** and **OAuth 2** (coming soon!)

<Callout type="info">
**Note:** When using Authorization, Agin Requests overrides your custom `Authorization` header with the selected auth method (if applicable).
</Callout>

## Basic Auth

Basic Authentication is a simple method of authentication that requires a username and a password. It encodes a string in the `{username}:{password}` format using Base64 and provides it in the `Authorization` header.

### Usage

In a request go to the **Authorization** tab, select **Basic** and provide your username and password.

## Bearer Auth

**Bearer Authentication** (also called **token authentication**) is an authentication scheme that involves security tokens called bearer tokens. The bearer token is a cryptic string, usually generated by the server in response to a login request. The client must send this token in the Authorization header when making requests to protected resources.

### Usage

In a request go to the **Authorization** tab, select **Bearer** and paste your Bearer token. You can also change the prefix, which gets sent before the token (by default it is set to `Bearer`).

## OAuth 2
